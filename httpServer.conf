# WEB SERVER CONFIGURATION
##

#
# DocumentRootStatic: The directory out of which you will
# serve your documents.
# This is the value set as 4D's "Default HTML Root" path, so
# files under this directory is returned by 4D HTTP server
# without any restriction when one is requested via URI.
# For files that restrictions are needed, place them under 
# "DocumentRootDynamic" directory and return them via 4D code.
#
# The directory path is written in absolute path format.
# Following substitution can be used:
#     {Database folder}: The folder containing the database structure file.
#
DocumentRootStatic "{Database folder}/WebFolder"

#
# DocumentRootDynamic: The directory out of which you will
# serve your documents.
# The difference between "DocumentRootStatic" and 
# "DocumentRootDynamic" are:
# Files placed in static folder will be returned without 
# any restriction by 4D web server when it is requested.
# On the other hand, since 4D Web server does not know 
# the presence of dynamic folder and its contents, to send
# those files as the response to the request, you must
# explicitly load and send them via 4D code.
# That means you have a full control of sending them or not.
# Additionally, when you want to embed data coming from 4D,
# you will use dynamic folder and send template file via
# 4D code since it triggers embedding data.
#
# The directory path is written in absolute path format.
# Following substitution can be used:
#     {Database folder}: The folder containing the database structure file.
#
DocumentRootDynamic "{Database folder}/WebFolderDynamic"

#
# ListenIPAddress: By default, 4D web server listen to
# requests coming through all IP addresses bound to the
# server machine. Change this to listen on specific IP
# address.
# 
# ListenIPAddress 192.168.100.100

#
# ListenPort: The port number 4D web server opens to
# listen to.
#
ListenPort 80

#
# ListenSSLPort: The port number 4D web server opens
# for secure connection.
#
ListenSSLPort 443

#
# CharacterSet: Character set that the 4D Web Server
# should use to communicate with browsers connecting
# to the database.
#
CharacterSet UTF-8

#
# HSTSMode: When enabled, 4D web server tells web browser
# whether the connection must be done under secure connetion
# by adding specific response header.
# Note that when you enable HSTS mode, secure connection
# must be configred by installing SSL keys otherwise connection
# could not be established.
#
HSTSMode off

#
# HSTSMaxAge: When HSTS mode is enabled, the max-age is
# used to tell web browser how long it should remember
# the status of the site's HSTS mode.
# The value is expressed in seconds.
# The default value is 63072000 sec = 2 years.
# Setting 0 second to this value may clear the browser's
# memory of the site's HSTS mode.
#
HSTSMaxAge 63072000

##
# 4D WEB SESSION MANAGEMENT
##

#
# AutoSessionManagement: Enables or disables the session
# management mode. When it is enabled, 4D will bind web
# session with a 4D process. As a result, 4D's process
# creation stage will be removed, thus the performance
# will increase.
#
# Security Note (WARNING)
# To bind web session with 4D process, 4D uses session ID
# generated by 4D and it is stored in cookie. 
# This session ID will never change until the web process is
# killed or timed out.
# If your web application includes login function,
# and use session ID stored in cookie to manage session,
# you must not rely on this session ID generated by 4D.
# To avoid "Session Fixation Attack", you must
# change session ID between before and after login process.
# Don't forget to issue custom session ID and use it
# to manage login status.
#
AutoSessionManagement on

#
# ProcessTimeout: Set the life duration of the inactive
# web process associated with web session.
# The value is expressed in minutes. The default value
# is 480 minutes (8 hours).
#
ProcessTimeout 480

#
# SessionTimeout: Set the life duration of the inactive
# web session. This value is set in cookie as expire value.
# The value is expressed in minutes. The default value
# is 480 minutes (8 hours).
#
SessionTimeout 480
